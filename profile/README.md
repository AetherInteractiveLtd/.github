## Aether Games

We're a new game development studio, and we will be accomplishing great things, just you wait.

Our GitHub has a bunch of our proudest projects, all open source for your enjoyment!

We've written our very own [Questing Language - ðŸ“œ Scribe](https://github.com/AetherInteractiveLtd/scribe), a whole [Game Framework - ðŸ–¥ Tina](https://github.com/AetherInteractiveLtd/Tina), and small libraries like a [UI Styling Utility - ðŸŽ¨ Rowind-Mini](https://github.com/AetherInteractiveLtd/rowind-mini).

We hope to make available a bunch of new and innovative tech, and can't wait to share what we're working on next! ðŸ˜„
